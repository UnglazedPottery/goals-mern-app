# goals-mern-app

Goals MERN Project
	- Build REST API with Express (backend NodeJS framework), MongoDB for database, Mongoose for connecting and interacting with db
		- use Postman (HTTP client tool) for testing REST API while its being built before there is a frontend
		- use MongoDB Atlas, cloud database, donâ€™t have to install it
	- Authentication for logging in and accessing protected routes with JWT (Json Web Tokens)
    - use bcrypt to encrypt passwords
	- React, Redux and Redux Toolkit for frontend  
	- using MongoDB to interact with the database will return a promise so use async/await
